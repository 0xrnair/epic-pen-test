# **OSCP**
This is a collection of useful scripts, tips and cheatsheet which I have compiled during my OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) Lab and exam. At times of darkness when I was frustrated and ready to throw in the towel these were the guiding light that kept me on track  


### TL;DR A bunch of reference materials for OSCP Labs/ general Pentesting for Windows/Unix
A general outline looks like the following 
- Reconnaissance
- Payloads
	- Webshells/Scripts for Shells
    - Esoteric shells
    - Usage of system resources
- Post-Exploitation
	- Pivoting


My writings will be weighted more towards post-exp due to the fact that it felt like the most hardest IMHO.
_Further Updates to this in the future ^_
